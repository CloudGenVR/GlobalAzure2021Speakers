## Twitch 
[Twitch Cloudgen Verona](https://www.twitch.tv/cloudgenverona)
Twitch event will be doing in parallel with the live shows on Friday 16, from 15:00 to 19:00
Twitch will be an informal live in which participants will be able to ask more detailed questions and we will get to know each speaker better.
It is not a mandatory appointment but as a community we like to get to know the speakers and their experiences.
We have a 20 minute slot for each speaker, both those who will do the live session and those who will do the recorded session.

## Recorded Sessions
We ask you to record the session lasting up to 1 hour. No problem for a few minutes more or a few minutes less.
The sessions are included in the agenda to share the link to our YouTube with the participants.
Once your videos have been uploaded, we will synchronize the information with the world organization and therefore it will not be necessary to enter your session in the portal https://globalazure.net/ because we will do it for you.
We ask you to let us have the presentation by Friday 9 April so we can do some post production and upload to YouTube.
You can record the session with the software you deem most appropriate, camtasia, streamlabs, obs or other. You can show yourself on cam at the bottom right or you can have a session where you don't show yourself on cam.

We are waiting for you as a guest during the Twitch live in which we will share your experience and we will introduce you to our community, there is nothing to prepare, we will send you the link a few days before the event, you will only need a browser and a cam. We will use Streamyard and it will be very easy.
